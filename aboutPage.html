    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Oscar Tayler. Welcome to my website! Here
        is a little about me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Work Experience</h4>
    <p>
        I am a student and Neumont and worked for 8 years in multiple
        departments of a company called InteriorWorX (IWX). While there
        I worked in software development, server administration, and
        project management. I left to pursue a proper degree and
        further my opportunities and Neumont. You can read about some
        notable projects I have completed in the "My Projects" page.
    </p>
    <h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
    <p>
        Besides computer science, I enjoy a wide range of activities and hobbies
        in my free time. I like playing tabletop games and fantasy video games. I
        also enjoy hiking the many peaks of the Wasatch Mountains and going
        rock climbing in the southern deserts of Utah.
